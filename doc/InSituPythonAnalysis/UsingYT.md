## Use yt for In Situ Python Analysis under Parallel Computation
`libyt` directly borrows parallel computation feature in `yt` using `mpi4py`. You can also refer to [**Parallel Computation With yt**](https://yt-project.org/doc/analyzing/parallel_computation.html#parallel-computation-with-yt).

We should always include the first three lines, then wrap the other statements inside Python functions, 
so that we can call these functions to conduct in situ analysis. (See [**Calling Python Functions**]({% link libytAPI/PerformInlineAnalysis.md %}#calling-python-functions).)

Because we now load data directly from `libyt`, we need to replace `yt.load()` to `yt_libyt.libytDataset()`.
Everything else is the same.

For example, the function `yt_inline` plots a density projection plot.
```python
# inline script
import yt_libyt                   # import libyt's yt frontend
import yt                         # import yt
yt.enable_parallelism()           # make yt work in parallelism feature

def yt_inline():
    ds = yt_libyt.libytDataset()  # <--> yt.load("Data")
    proj = yt.ProjectionPlot(ds, "density")
    if yt.is_root():
        proj.save()
```

## Supported yt Functionalities
These are the functions we have tested.
Basically, everything will work in Python under parallel computation using `mpi4py`.

Reading and accessing data is a collective operation, and it requires every MPI process to join.
If only some of the processes participate in reading data during a yt function, then the program will hang, 
because some processes are blocked at data reading stage and waiting for other processes to join.

For example, `volume_render`, which has a restriction of working under even MPI processes only.
And plots with annotations `annotate_quiver`, `annotate_cquiver`, `annotate_velocity`, `annotate_line_integral_convolution`, 
`annotate_magnetic_field`, and `annotate_particles`, need to access data when saving figure. 
Which means every MPI process should run `save()`, and we have to move `save()` outside of `if yt.is_root()`.

## Distinguish libyt Fields and yt Fields

### libyt Fields and yt Fields
- **libyt fields** are fields loaded or generated by `libyt`. They are fields defined inside [`yt_get_FieldsPtr`]({% link libytAPI/FieldInfo/SetFieldsInformation.md %}#yt_get_fieldsptr). It could be actual simulation field data, or data generated through [derived field function]({% link libytAPI/FieldInfo/DerivedField.md %}#derived-field-function).
- **yt fields** are fields defined in field information class (class `XXXFieldInfo`) in yt frontend, or yt built-in fields. `XXX` is frontend name defined in `frontend` in [`yt_param_yt`]({% link libytAPI/SetYTParameter.md %}#yt_param_yt).

### How to Use them in In Situ Analysis
- Add `frontend` name if you are referring to **libyt fields**. An example of calling **libyt fields** in `gamer` frontend:

  ```python
  def yt_inline():
      ds = yt_libyt.libytDataset()
      sz = yt.ProjectionPlot(ds, 'z', ("gamer", "velocity_x"), center='c')
      if yt.is_root():
          sz.save()
  ```
  
- An example of calling **yt fields**:

  ```python
  def yt_inline():
      ds = yt_libyt.libytDataset()
      sz = yt.ProjectionPlot(ds, 'z', "velocity_x", center='c')
      if yt.is_root():
          sz.save()
  ```

## Frequently Asked Question
### Why does my program hang and how do I solve it?
This is probably due to only some MPI processes are accessing the data, and not all of them.

Please do:
1. Check if there is an if statements that makes MPI processes non-symmetric. For example, only root process runs the statement:
  ```python
  def func():
      if yt.is_root():
          ...  # <-- This statement only executes in MPI root rank
  ```
2. Move the statement out of `if yt.is_root()` (for the case here).
